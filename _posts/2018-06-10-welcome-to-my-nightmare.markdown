So this is the world famous Jekyll? Seems pretty ass-simple to me; no CMS to muck about with and it outputs static HTML. I need to find an up-to-date tutorial because the one from 2015 is not working for me.

Hot damn though! This thing detects when I add a file or make a change, and immediately pushes it out the test server. Holy fucksticks that is cool!
