_Only add Facebook friends that you know. This is common advice, and many people give it but as I find out in my experiment, many people don't follow it. As of this writing, over 500 people have added me and more are sure to follow._

## Introduction

I get random Facebook requests all of the time. Historically, I've just deleted them. End of story. But one day I got one and thought "what would happen if I programmatically added people? How many random people would accept?"

So I set out to learn. I found a JavaScript snippet that clicks all of the "add friend" buttons for you and away I went. Soon, I was blocked from sending friend requests.

## The Experiment

I wanted to know how many people would add a creepy male profile with no profile picture. Luckily, the block on me sending friend requests was for less than twelve hours. I found that sending about one-hundred requests at one time was a good limit.

First, it was friends of friends. Then it was friends of friends of friends. Then, all Hell broke loose and I was making "friends" all over the world.

Some of them were Chinese, selling vape kits at wholesale prices. Others were Americans, purportedly selling weed. Some were Arabs selling pharmaceuticals. And one guy was even selling DMT.

A few were perverts, asking me to "like" pages filled with pictures of scantily clad women or join secret groups filled with pornographic images. These profiles, pages and groups are sure to be deleted as Facebook finds them. I'm no snitch, however. Facebook won't find out from me.

In two days I had added 524 new friends. Most of them left me alone but a few wanted to chat. Facebook is a social media website after all ... the random calls from Arabs at three in the morning were annoying though.

## Only add Facebook Friends That you Know

Overall, nothing bad happened. But adding random people has turned my Facebook account into a seemingly endless stream of spam. Like I said, many of my newfound friends are trying to sell things; thank God for the unfollow button.

However, people who add Facebook friends that they do not know open themselves up to a world of trouble. With people sharing nearly every aspect of their lives online it's a wonder I haven't seen news of a Facebook stalker murdering someone yet. Where's some people's sense of privacy? Some things are not meant to be shared.

I'll get off my soapbox now. I don't know if I've made my point or not. People are bound to do as they will but reader: _only add Facebook friends that you know!_
