Marijuana tourism is a thing nowadays and tourists search for a nearby dispensary on their smartphones. Top results are usually Leafly or Weedmaps, followed by the dispensary's website. But believe it or not, some dispensaries don't have a website at all!

It's official: businesses need websites. Having a Facebook and Yelp! presence isn't enough; you need a website to succeed at the fullest potential. Not having a website can be disastrous.

At the same time, having a poorly executed website can be a death sentence. Not mobile friendly? These days most people search for businesses on their phone, strike one.

Ugly? Well, I'll call it a strike because I like pretty websites but in reality, a website merely needs to be useful. But I make pretty websites ... pretty and hopefully useful too!

Slow? This is the killer strike three. Nobody likes a slow website. No excuse can get you out of it, your website needs to be fast.

I'm going to start building dispensary websites. What do the previous paragraphs have to do with that? Over the weekend I searched every last entry in the Oregon Liquor Control  Commission database of marijuana dispensaries. Many of them either had ugly or non-existent websites.

As a designer, I could never walk up to a dispensary owner and say "your website sucks so hire me to fix it." They probably paid someone a generous sum to set it up. Or, maybe the designer was cringing while the customer got what they wanted; who knows? Or maybe, they set it up themselves. Any way you look at it, being rude won't get you very far when you're trying to get someone to give you money.

As a designer, I can approach dispensaries that have no website and say "hey, you need one. Hire me." So this is what I plan to do. A bit of a change in pace but I think concentrating on one specific niche in the broad field of web design will pay me dividends.

I've already mocked one up, which you can see for yourself at http://dispensary.jamestibbets.com. I think she's pretty and I think you will too! Most important, I think the customers I hope to find will love it.

For ease of use WordPress will be employed. WordPress is an open-source content management system that is either free to use with the end-user providing their own website hosting (preferred option) or as a commercial product that includes everything out of the box (more expensive). WordPress powers 30% of the internet as of March 2018 according to VentureBeat.com and will enable my customers to add additional pages and content in the future with ease.

A dispensary menu can be provided that does not rely on any third-party services. This menu can include pictures and can appear in several places on the website. This menu can be easily updated by a customer at any time and will enable their potential customers to see what they have before they stop in. What if they already have a Leafly or a Weedmaps menu set up? No problem! Menus from these providers can be embedded on their website as well.

I think I have a golden idea. I think I'm going to make a mint off of the Oregon market alone. Word will spread and I'll likely make a mint off of other states as well. Who knows, maybe one of my websites will change Jeff Sessions' mind about pot?
